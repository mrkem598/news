This project uses the full MERN stack to retrieve articles from the New York Times API, and then allows the user to save notes, which are organized from newest to oldest.  The next improvement would be to add the ability to add notes to each article and to make the UI nicer.

This was a great project, it allowed me to work with the entire stack, it's my favorite boot camp project so far, I put over 20 hours into it, plus over 40 hours of studying React and MongoDB this week!  This is my favorite stack now, I want to dive much deeper into these technologies!  

Here's a link to the deployed project on Heroku:
